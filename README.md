# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-An-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

This project focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a breast cancer diagnosis dataset. The dataset contains various medical features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses, categorized into mean, standard error, and worst values. The goal is to analyze key patterns, relationships, and feature importance in distinguishing malignant and benign cases.

Through data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques like histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps, this study identifies critical predictors of breast cancer. Insights from this analysis can be used for further predictive modeling and clinical decision-making. ðŸš€
